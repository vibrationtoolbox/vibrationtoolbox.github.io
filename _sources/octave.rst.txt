Installing Octave
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Just like Python or Matlab, there are two steps. First, install Octave, then install the Engineering Vibration Toolbox.

Installing Octave on Windows
****************************

The availability of a simple `Octave installer for Windows <https://www.gnu.org/software/octave/download.html>`_ has been
sporadic. At the moment (11-August-2018) there is an installer available at the link in the preceding sentence. I do
recommend that path when available. When it's not, `Cygwin`_ is a reliable, if more difficult, alternative.


In order to install Octave via Cygwin (**Not your easiest method!**):

1. Download and install `Cygwin`_.

2. You may have to run setup multiple times to install the parts you
   need. Install, at minimum:

   a. ``Octave`` (Math section- octave: GNU Octave language...)

   b. ``xinit`` (X11 section)

   c. ``unzip``

3. Go to the Windows Menu. In ``Cygwin-X`` run ``XWin Server``

4. A green X should appear on the dock. You should be able to bring up
   a menu to launch ``Octave``

Installing Octave on Mac
************************

Installing Octave on a Mac will take multiple steps. Please see `Octave for MacOS <https://wiki.octave.org/Octave_for_macOS>`_. I personally use the `MacPorts method <macports.org>`_

Installing Octave on Linux
**************************

Octave is available as a package install on most Linux distributions.

Summary
*******

If you can't get it to work on Mac or Windows, installing on Ubuntu is easy. So, you can always use `VirtualBox`_ and run it in a virtual machine (for free). I do for my testing, so indeed it works just fine.


Installing, Updating, and Removing The Toolbox
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


Windows Installation
********************

`Click on this
<https://github.com/vibrationtoolbox/ovtoolbox/archive/master.zip>`_
to download the vibration toolbox to your Downloads folder.

Copy and paste this into your Octave window

.. code-block:: octave

	  system('curl -4 -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vibrationtoolbox/ovtoolbox/master/inst/vtbud.m>vtbud.m')
		vtbud
		delete('vtbud.m')

.. warning::

   You must ``pkg load vtoolbox`` each time you run Octave if you do not put this command in you ``~/.octaverc`` file. If editing of this doesn't happen automatically, and you want this behavior, type ``edit('~/.octaverc')`` at you Octave prompt to edit it yourself.

Linux and Mac Installation
**************************

Linux and MacOS are very similar underneath, so instructions apply equally.

1. Run `Octave`_.

2. Copy and paste this into `Octave`_.

.. code-block:: octave

   [s, success, message]=urlwrite('https://github.com/vibrationtoolbox/ovtoolbox/archive/master.zip','vtoolbox.zip')
   pkg install vtoolbox.zip
   delete('vtoolbox.zip')
   pkg load vtoolbox
   vtbud
   ;

Alternatively, you can also download ``vtbud.m`` and run it to perform
the install for you (copy and paste this at the Octave prompt)

.. code-block:: octave

		system('curl -4 -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vibrationtoolbox/ovtoolbox/master/inst/vtbud.m>vtbud.m')
		vtbud
		delete('vtbud.m')

**Note**: If you use the Download button on `github <github.com>`_, you **must** rename
the downloaded file to :code:`vtoolbox.zip` and manually use
:code:`pkg install vtoolbox.zip` after renaming the downloaded ``zip``
file to ``vtoolbox.zip``.

.. note::

   You must ``pkg load vtoolbox`` each time you run Octave if you do not put this command in you ``~/.octaverc`` file. If editing of this doesn't happen automatically, and you want this behavior, type ``edit('~/.octaverc')`` at you Octave prompt to edit it yourself.


To update:
**********
To update, run :code:`vtbud` in `Octave`_ if you have updated since Feb 23, 2016.

Otherwise, run `Octave`_ and paste the following to the prompt:

.. code-block:: octave

   pkg uninstall vtoolbox
   [s, success, message]=urlwrite('https://github.com/vibrationtoolbox/ovtoolbox/archive/master.zip','vtoolbox.zip')
   pkg install vtoolbox.zip
   delete('vtoolbox.zip')
   ;


To remove:
**********

Because it takes so little space (trivial compared to a small Word
document), I would suggest simply deactivating it


In `Octave`_

.. code-block:: octave

   pkg unload vtoolbox

This will hide it but leave it available. You may also want to ``edit('~/.octaverc')`` to stop it from loading each time you run Octave.

To remove it completely, in `Octave`_

.. code-block:: octave

   pkg uninstall vtoolbox
   [s, success, message]=urlwrite('https://github.com/vibrationtoolbox/ovtoolbox/archive/master.zip','vtoolbox.zip')
   pkg install vtoolbox.zip
   delete('vtoolbox.zip')
   ;

You may have to look around and make sure no files ``vtoolbox.zip``, ``master.zip``, or similar exist.

*Why the semi-colons?* It's my way of making sure you don't leave the
last command unexecuted.

Troubleshooting installation:
***********************************

:code:`vtbud` was initially buggy and is still quite new. If :code:`vtbud`
isn't working, please perform a clean install with the following

.. code-block::octave

   pkg uninstall vtoolbox
   delete('vtbud.m')
   system('curl -4 -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vibrationtoolbox/ovtoolbox/master/inst/vtbud.m>vtbud.m')
   vtbud
   delete('vtbud.m')

The first delete is to make sure you aren't able to run an old version
of ``vtbud.m``. The second is to make sure it is updated in the future.


Printing plots
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

..
    To print a plot, the easiest way may be to type :code:`print` from the Octave
    console.

..
    This *may* bring up dialog boxes that enable you to send the
    current plot to your current Windows printer. SO

The :code:`print` command can be used to generate graphics files for
embedding into your favorite word processing program. Type :code:`help print`
for details. By default the file used end up in the current directory
which is likely your home directory. The command :code:`pwd` can be
used to determine your current directory. On Windows using Cygwin,
this might be a bit complex. The file is likely located in
``C:\cygwin64\home\`` *username* where *username* is your account
name. Alternatively, ``cygwin64`` may be something else similar. I
suggest finding this directory  with the Windows File Browser and
pinning it to the Quick Access area (Windows 10) by dragging it there.
