Overview
==========

The Engineering Vibration Toolbox is a set of over 35 educational
programs and associated files by `Joseph C.
Slater <http://josephcslater.github.io>`__ (Python version with Raphael Timb√≥).
It can be run on any platform supported by
`Matlab <http://www.mathworks.com/>`__
`Octave <http://www.octave.org>`__  (Mac, Windows, VMS, Unix, Cygwin), or `Python`_. Also
included are help files, examples, and files containing raw
experimental data. The codes include single degree of freedom
response, response spectrum, finite elements, numerical integration,
modal analysis and phase plane analysis. It was originally designed for use with
the text "Engineering Vibration" by `Prof. Daniel J. Inman <http://www.engin.umich.edu/college/about/people/profiles/f-to-j/daniel-inman>`__ (`Prentice
Hall <http://www.prenhall.com>`__) but has expanded since then.

I highly recommend use of
`Octave <http://www.octave.org>`__ or `Python`_ if possible, as they are free. If you know `Matlab <http://www.mathworks.com/>`__, you already
know most of `Octave <http://www.octave.org>`__. Most students will hardly know the difference,
except that it's free! The *Octavized*
toolbox can be found `here <https://github.com/vibrationtoolbox/ovtoolbox>`__, but is more easily installed using the :ref:`ovinstall`. Further, the licensing is
less restrictive (no charge for professional use!). The entire archive
can be `downloaded as a zip file <https://github.com/vibrationtoolbox/ovtoolbox/archive/master.zip>`__. Please
refer to the `Octave web site <http://www.octave.org>`__ for details on obtaining and installing
`Octave <http://www.octave.org>`__.

`Python`_ is not much different in style and capability, especially when using `Spyder <http://pythonhosted.org/spyder/>`__.  It's a much more capable language for general computing and is becoming the de facto introductory programming language in engineering and computer science and is `one of the most in-demand languages <http://www.codingdojo.com/blog/9-most-in-demand-programming-languages-of-2017/>`__. That means learning not only develops your computational skills, but also develops your broader programming toolbox. The `Python version <http://vibrationtoolbox.github.io/vibration_toolbox/>`_ is also the most quickly developing version of the Vibration Toolbox.

If you are new to vibration, you can learn about what vibration is and why it's important at the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Structural Dynamics Technical Committee `Exploring Structural Dynamics website <www.exploringstructuraldynamics.org>`__.


Download and Installation
==============================

Using the Engineering Vibration Toolbox (Matlab and Octave)
===========================================================

Typing :code:`help vtb#`, where ``#`` is a number, will provide a table of contents for the files
related to chapter '?'. Typing :code:`help codename` will provide help on the
particular code. Note  that the ``filename`` is ``codename.m``.

Engineering Vibration Toolbox commands can be run by typing them with
the necessary arguments just as any other Octave/Matlab
commands/functions. For instance, :code:`vtb1_1` can be run by typing
:code:`vtb1_1(1,.1,1,1,0,10)`. Many functions have multiple forms of input.
The help for each function shows this flexibility.

Acknowledgments
===============

Support for the Engineering Vibration Toolbox for Octave has come from a number of
sources. First and foremost, Daniel J. Inman, who initially tasked
me and Donald J. Leo to write version 3.0 of the software for his text
*Engineering Vibration* by Dr. Daniel J. Inman (Prentice Hall, 1994). I
also thank the Department of Mechanical and Materials Engineering and
the College of Engineering and Computer Science at Wright State
University for providing the computer resources for developing the
Matlab 4 version of the software. Perhaps the people who have given the
most are my students who painfully experienced every piece of beta code,
often at the least opportune times. Thanks is also given to Dr. Maurice
Petyt and Robert C. Chiroux For their patience in testing numerous 4.0
beta versions of this software. Finally, John W. Eaton and others for
writing/coordinating/developing/supporting Octave. Please see the
Octave_ website for more information on Octave and how you can
support its development.
