Download and Installation
==============================

`The Engineering Vibration Toolbox for Python`_
-----------------------------------------------

Installing the Engineering Vibration Toolbox on Python is as easy as using the `pip`. The easy way to install is to simply type

.. code-block:: python

   pip install --user vibration_toolbox

Please see the `python manual <http://vibrationtoolbox.github.io/vibration_toolbox/>`_ for more details. 


The Engineering Vibration Toolbox for `Matlab`_
-----------------------------------------------------------

The Engineering Vibration Toolbox can be installed by downloading
`vtbud.m`_ and executing it from within Matlab_. Executing it after installation
later updates or removes the toolbox per user selection.

.. warning::
   You will get an error if ``vtbud.m`` is not in your path.
   Installation of the Vibration Toolbox via the easy method may be broken if you have multiple instances of vtoolbox files installed. If you duplicate or otherwise modify the files, please rename them and move them outside the toolbox folder. If that happens, open ``vtbud.m`` in the Matlab_ editor and press the F5 key.

This will download ``vtoolbox.zip``, expand it in the desired location, and add the path to it to your default Matlab_ path.

.. note::
   After installation has completed you must delete the ``vtbud.m`` file that you saved. The location is listed in your Matlab_ console.

Alternatively, copy and
paste this into your Matlab_ command console:

.. code-block:: matlab

   »  urlwrite('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vibrationtoolbox/vtoolbox/master/vtbud.m','vtbud.m');vtbud;delete vtbud.m;

and press RETURN.

.. warning::
   If your current working directory is not writable (you don't own it in the sense of computer security), this line will fail. In that case you need to use the Matlab_ `cd command`_ to change to a different directory or manually download ``vtbud.m`` before you run this line.

.. warning::
   Do not store any data or personal files inside the vtoolbox directory. They may be deleted or overwritten.

The current revision status of the `Engineering Vibration Toolbox`_ for
Matlab_ can be viewed in the `github repository <https://github.com/vibrationtoolbox/vtoolbox>`_ or more easily in the `vtbud.txt <https://github.com/vibrationtoolbox/vtoolbox/blob/master/vtbud.txt>`_ file on this website.

Troubleshooting
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A list of updates since 1/1/98
can be obtained for your current version by typing :code:`help vtbud` in
Matlab. That can be compared to the `most up-to-date release <https://github.com/vibrationtoolbox/vtoolbox/blob/master/vtbud.txt>`__.

They will load/run on all platforms supported by Matlab. The binary files are all ``.mat`` files, and the different extensions represent different parts of a project group. To load
them type:

.. code-block:: matlab

   » load filename -mat

where » is the Matlab prompt. [#]_ The
filename must include the extension unless it is ``.mat``.

If you can't execute any of the ``.m`` files (try for
example typing :code:`vtbud` from the Matlab prompt), they
are either not in the Matlab path, or did not get
transferred in the correct format (unlikely these days). Use the :code:`cd` command (like DOS) from
within Matlab to move to the ``vtoolbox`` directory. If
you can see the files using :code:`dir`, and still cannot execute them, then try
transferring the text files again, being sure that they are transferred in
ASCII (text) format.

Removing the Engineering Vibration Toolbox:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Type :code:`vtbud` from the Matlab prompt.

The Engineering Vibration Toolbox for `Octave <octave.org>`__
-------------------------------------------------------------
Please read the `Readme.rst
<https://github.com/vibrationtoolbox/ovtoolbox/blob/master/Readme.rst>`__
file for information not covered elsewhere.

Installing, Updating, and Removing The Toolbox
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


Windows Installation
**********************************

The availability of a simple `Octave installer for Windows <octave.org>`__ has been
sporadic. At the moment (30-March-2016) there is one available. I do
recommend that path when available, but when it's not, `Cygwin <cygwin.com>`__ is a reliable alternative.


In order to install Octave via Cygwin:

1. Download and install `Cygwin <cygwin.com>`__.

2. You may have to run setup multiple times to install the parts you
   need. Install, at minimum:

   a. ``Octave`` (Math section- octave: GNU Octave language...)

   b. ``xinit`` (X11 section)

   c. ``unzip``

3. Go to the Windows Menu. In ``Cygwin-X`` run ``XWin Server``

4. A green X should appear on the dock. You should be able to bring up
   a menu to launch ``Octave``

5. `Click on this
   <https://github.com/vibrationtoolbox/ovtoolbox/archive/master.zip>`__
   to download the vibration toolbox to your Downloads folder.

Copy and paste this into your Octave window

.. code-block:: octave

		system('curl -4 -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vibrationtoolbox/ovtoolbox/master/inst/vtbud.m>vtbud.m')
		vtbud
		delete('vtbud.m')

..
   Here you will see a list of users on your computer. You need to figure
   out which one is you. For me, it's `Joseph C. Slater`. So for my
   installation  I continue
   with (note the single quotes)

   .. code-block:: octave

		   cd 'Joseph C. Slater'

   You should be able to copy and paste the rest of this into Octave to
   complete the process.

   .. code-block:: octave

		   cd Downloads
		   rename('ovtoolbox-master.zip','vtoolbox.zip')
		   pkg install vtoolbox.zip
		   delete('vtoolbox.zip')
		   ;


Linux and Mac Installation
*****************************

1. Run `Octave`_.

2. Copy and paste this into `Octave`_.

.. code-block:: octave

   [s, success, message]=urlwrite('https://github.com/vibrationtoolbox/ovtoolbox/archive/master.zip','vtoolbox.zip')
   pkg install vtoolbox.zip
   delete('vtoolbox.zip')
   vtb
   ;

Alternatively, you can also download ``vtbud.m`` and run it to perform
the install for you (copy and paste this at the Octave prompt)

.. code-block:: octave

		system('curl -4 -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vibrationtoolbox/ovtoolbox/master/inst/vtbud.m>vtbud.m')
		vtbud
		delete('vtbud.m')

**Note**: If you use the Download button on `github <github.com>`__, you **must** rename
the downloaded file to :code:`vtoolbox.zip` and manually use
:code:`pkg install vtoolbox.zip` after renaming the downloaded ``zip``
file to ``vtoolbox.zip``.

To update:
****************
To update, run :code:`vtbud` in `Octave`_ if you have updated since Feb 23, 2016.

Otherwise, run `Octave`_ and paste the following to the prompt:

.. code-block:: octave

   pkg uninstall vtoolbox
   [s, success, message]=urlwrite('https://github.com/vibrationtoolbox/ovtoolbox/archive/master.zip','vtoolbox.zip')
   pkg install vtoolbox.zip
   delete('vtoolbox.zip')
   ;



To remove:
*****************

Because it takes so little space (trivial compared to a small Word
document), I would suggest simply deactivating it


In `Octave`_

.. code-block:: octave

   pkg unload vtoolbox

To remove it completely, in `Octave`_

.. code-block:: octave

   pkg uninstall vtoolbox
   [s, success, message]=urlwrite('https://github.com/vibrationtoolbox/ovtoolbox/archive/master.zip','vtoolbox.zip')
   pkg install vtoolbox.zip
   delete('vtoolbox.zip')
   ;

You may have to look around and make sure no files ``vtoolbox.zip``, ``master.zip``, or
similar exist.

*Why the semi-colons?* It's my way of making sure you don't leave the
last command unexecuted.

Troubleshooting installation:
***********************************

:code:`vtbud` was initially buggy and is still quite new. If :code:`vtbud`
isn't working, please perform a clean install with the following

.. code-block::octave

   pkg uninstall vtoolbox
   delete('vtbud.m')
   system('curl -4 -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vibrationtoolbox/ovtoolbox/master/inst/vtbud.m>vtbud.m')
   vtbud
   delete('vtbud.m')

The first delete is to make sure you aren't able to run an old version
of ``vtbud.m``. The second is to make sure it is updated in the future.

Printing plots
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

..
    To print a plot, the easiest way may be to type :code:`print` from the Octave
    console.

..
    This *may* bring up dialog boxes that enable you to send the
    current plot to your current Windows printer. SO

The :code:`print` command can be used to generate graphics files for
embedding into your favorite word processing program. Type :code:`help print`
for details. By default the file used end up in the current directory
which is likely your home directory. The command :code:`pwd` can be
used to determine your current directory. On Windows using Cygwin,
this might be a bit complex. The file is likely located in
``C:\cygwin64\home\`` *username* where *username* is your account
name. Alternatively, ``cygwin64`` may be something else similar. I
suggest finding this directory  with the Windows File Browser and
pinning it to the Quick Access area (Windows 10) by dragging it there.



Acknowledgments
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Support for the Engineering Vibration Toolbox for Octave has come from a number of
sources. First and foremost, Daniel J. Inman, who initially tasked
me and Donald J. Leo to write version 3.0 of the software for his text
*Engineering Vibration* by Dr. Daniel J. Inman (Prentice Hall, 1994). I
also thank the Department of Mechanical and Materials Engineering and
the College of Engineering and Computer Science at Wright State
University for providing the computer resources for developing the
Matlab 4 version of the software. Perhaps the people who have given the
most are my students who painfully experienced every piece of beta code,
often at the least opportune times. Thanks is also given to Dr. Maurice
Petyt and Robert C. Chiroux For their patience in testing numerous 4.0
beta versions of this software. Finally, John W. Eaton and others for
writing/coordinating/developing/supporting Octave. Please see the
Octave_ website for more information on Octave and how you can
support its development.

Using the Engineering Vibration Toolbox
=====================================================

Typing :code:`help vtb#`, where ``#`` is a number, will provide a table of contents for the files
related to chapter '?'. Typing :code:`help codename` will provide help on the
particular code. Note  that the ``filename`` is ``codename.m``.

Engineering Vibration Toolbox commands can be run by typing them with
the necessary arguments just as any other Octave/Matlab
commands/functions. For instance, :code:`vtb1_1` can be run by typing
:code:`vtb1_1(1,.1,1,1,0,10)`. Many functions have multiple forms of input.
The help for each function shows this flexibility.


Faculty/Instructors/GTAs
=========================
Please send comments and questions regarding the Engineering Vibration
Toolbox by email to `Joseph C. Slater`_. Please use the `vtbud.m`_
function to check for updates (Type :code:`vtbud` at the Matlab prompt).

Donate/Payment
===============
The Engineering Vibration Toolbox for Matlab (not the Octave version,
or any version that runs on a non-proprietary platform) is free only
