% VTB2%% VTB2_1 plots the forced response of an undamped single degree%        of freedom system to a sinusiodal input.% VTB2_2 plots the forced response of an underdamped single%        degree of freedom system to a sinusiodal input.% VTB2_3 plots the frequency response (transfer) function of a %        single degree of freedom damped system.% VTB2_4 plots the displacement transmissibility ration and%        force transmissibility ration of a single degree of %        freedom damped system.% VTB2_5 plots the displacement and phase of a system with%        rotating imbalance as a function of frequency.% VTB2_6 plots the free decay of a single degree of freedom%        system with viscous, coulomb, or air damping.
