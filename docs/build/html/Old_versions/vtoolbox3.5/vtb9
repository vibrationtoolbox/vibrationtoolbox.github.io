% VTB9% % VTB9_1 solves for the natural frequencies, damping ratios, %        and mode shapes of a linear second order matrix (LSOM)%        form system.  (m,d,k)% VTB9_2 numerically integrates to find the unforced response %        of a system using Euler's method.  The system can%        be in state space or LSOM form.% VTB9_3 perfoms fourth Runge-Kutta integration on a set of%        equations described in a specified file.  The %        equations need not be linear.% VTB9_4 numerically integrates to find the forced response %        of a system using Euler's method.  The system can%        be in state space or LSOM form.
