% VTB7%% VTB7_1 is an example of taking a power spectral density%        of data. The power spectral density of a signal%        containing .5 Hz and 1.59 Hz signals is plotted.% VTB7_2 generates the discrete frequency response%        function (H(iw)) between two signals.% VTB7_3 A set of files numbered from VTB7_3_1.mat to%        VTB7_3_6.mat exist which contain discrete frequency%        response functions.  After loading the data,%        plot(FreqV,abs(Xfer)) will give the magnitude%        and plot(FreqV,angle(Xfer)) will give the phase%        plot.  Note the differences between experimental%        data and what you would expect from theory.
